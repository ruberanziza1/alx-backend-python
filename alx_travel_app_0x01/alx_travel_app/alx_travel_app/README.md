# Milestone 3: Creating Views and API Endpoints

## Creating Views and API Endpoints

### Objective

Build API views to manage listings and bookings, and ensure the endpoints are documented with Swagger.

## Instructions

- ### Duplicate Project:

    - Duplicate the project `alx_travel_app_0x00` to `alx_travel_app_0x01`
- ### Create ViewSets:

  - In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST frameworkâ€™s ModelViewSet.
  - Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.

- ### Configure URLs:

  - Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
  - Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
- ### Test Endpoints:

  - Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.
